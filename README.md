#Build a website that displays the data below in a meaningful way.

##Guidelines:
* Should look "nice".  Doesn't need to be a design masterpiece, but should be pleasant to look at.  
* Bonus if responsive on small / medium and large screen size (responsive design)
* Page(s) must be available on the internet publically
* Code must be cloned and available on github or bitbucket (using git source control)
* Server side language is open (if it is required)
* A single page style client side javascript app is recommended
